- in his video [The Most Useful Calendar View in 2025 That No One Told You About](https://youtu.be/SQHYj7x-t3A&t=702) from his channel [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking)

### why a **yearly linear** calendar?
- you might find answer to every aspect of this question in Milo's video
- but in simple words
  - it's the possibililty to see your entire year **on one page**

### is that all?

- **linDar** is more than a calendar display
  - it's a cross-platform organisational tool
  - linking all you devices
    - working as a client for synchronisation with CalDAV servers (as Nextcloud)
    - providing a securised .ics web-link for sharing with almost any mobile or desktop calendar app .. and friends
